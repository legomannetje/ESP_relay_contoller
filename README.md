Be free to you some parts of my program,
let me know if you made some improvements of found any bugs!

What does this program?

  It allow's you to control leds, or in my case, a relay over the internet.

How you use it?

  Change rule 9 and 10 of Version1_Github/Version1_Github.ino to your own settings
  Upload the file and open the Serial Monitor, if everything is allright you should see the IP.
  Go to the ESP and fill in the username: admin, and password: admin
  once logged in you can change your password by clicking Generate password
  fill in the new password en paste in in the file where is the old password
  
  The controlling of the led speaks for it selfs. Make sure that the rights pins are defined
  that will prevent a lot of trouble

If you have any questions, be free to ask!
